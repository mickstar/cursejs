# CurseJS

A nodeJS based implementation of the CurseAPI for bot developers.

## Informations

**This is far from being any close to stable, that's why you won't find it in npm yet**

This is an early early early alpha of the development of this lib, but since there is not much out here, I think it's better than nothing.

There is no documentation yet, I will re-write the logging system very soon, and lots of endpoints will come soon!
About the License ! I know I need to put it in every file, but I'm lazy to do it right now, will do in next commits.

If you want to join the project, or just discuss about Curse implementations you can join this server !
